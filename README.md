# Nuxt Side Project with H3 and HTTP API

This is a side project to explore creating a server-side API using H3 and HTTP within a Nuxt application, accompanied by its front-end components and layout.

## Installation

Install the required dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install

# bun
bun install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000` for live code reloading and hot module replacement:

bash

# npm

npm run dev

# pnpm

pnpm run dev

# yarn

yarn dev

# bun

bun run dev

## Production

Build the application for deployment to a production environment:

# npm

npm run build

# pnpm

pnpm run build

# yarn

yarn build

# bun

bun run build

## Project Structure

The project is structured with a clear separation between the server-side API and front-end components:

├── api # Server-side API using H3 and HTTP
│ ├── index.js # Main API entry point
│ └── routes # API routes and endpoints
├── components # Reusable front-end components
│ ├── layout # Base layout for all pages
│ └── pages # Individual page components
└── nuxt.config.js # Nuxt configuration file

## Further Development

This project provides a foundation for exploring Nuxt server-side APIs and integrating them with front-end components. You can continue to develop and expand the functionalities as needed.
